# COMP308Project

This code is probably not that tidy...

It was part of a group project. I implemented the volumetric lighting, mainly working on 'engine.cpp', 'engine.hpp'.

A lot of the basics of the program were provided in previous assignments (main.cpp, cgra_geometry.hpp, cgra_math.hpp)


Using CMake and Visual Studio 2015 on Windows in \build\ directory:

Using CMake and Linux (Victoria University of Wellington Linux build):

  mkdir build

  cd build

  cmake ../work

  make

  cd ..

  ./build/bin/project
